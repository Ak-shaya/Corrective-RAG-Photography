Overexposure occurs when too much light hits the camera sensor, resulting in a washed-out image.
Common causes include a high ISO setting, slow shutter speed, or a wide aperture in bright conditions.
To fix overexposure, reduce ISO, increase shutter speed, or narrow the aperture.
Framing is crucial in portrait photography. Avoid cutting off limbs awkwardly or placing the subject dead-center without purpose.
Side lighting helps create dramatic portraits with depth and texture.
